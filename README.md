# logica-programacion
2nd semester at IUTCM - Programming Logic <br>

These are my homework for my university. In this chapter, we saw everything except arrays. <br>
Here you can find: <br>
-While do <br>
-If else/switch <br>
-Relational Operators <br>
-Logic Operators <br>
-Arithmetic Operators <br>
-Assignation Operators <br>
-Syntax and stuff life <br>
<br>
Note: This is C++. And I am learning so don't except a beautiful syntaxis because you may not find it.
