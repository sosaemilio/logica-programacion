# logica-programacion
2nd semester at IUTCM - Programming Logic

These are my homework for my university. In this chapter, we saw everything except arrays. 
Here you can find: /n
-While do /n
-If else/switch /n
-Relational Operators
-Logic Operators
-Arithmetic Operators
-Assignation Operators
-Syntax and stuff life

Note: This is C++. And I am learning so don't except a beautiful syntaxis because you may not find it.
